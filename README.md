# RimMinmatarShips, A SOS2 ship pack.

**IN RUST WE TRUST**

An EVE online themed ship pack for the Rimworld mod Save Our Ship 2. Does not add new items, just ship designs to encounter/blast/capture in your playthroughs.

_EVE online belongs to CCP hf. Rimworld belongs to Ludeon studios._

## About

Minmatar ships in EVE have the reputation of being made out of scrap metal, solar sails and duct tape. They're fast, favour shields over armour and use ballistic weaponry, with a side dish of overwhelming missiles.

### The designs

* Use unpowered hull walls where possible (very slightly better for game performance)
* Prioritize Speed -> Shield -> Armor. More Engines!
* Primary weapons are Plasma turrets (medium range); as sadly the SOS2 AI does not currently get into range to use Projectile turrets, and lasers being the primary weapon of the Minmatar's enemy faction, those were avoided. Regular Rimworld autoturrets are however still good anti-boarding measures.
* To make pretend solar sails, a bunch of designs are 100% solar powered!
